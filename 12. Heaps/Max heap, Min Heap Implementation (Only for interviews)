Code Studio blog link to study about Implementation of Min heap and Max heap : https://www.codingninjas.com/codestudio/library/implementation-of-heap

=>Heap is a :-
1. Tree data structure.
2. Complete Binary Tree. (All levels are completely filled, nodes in the last level are as left as possible.)
3. Tree where the element with the highest or the lowest priority is always stored at the ‘root’ of the tree.

=>Heapify - The process of rearranging the heap by comparing each parent with its children recursively is called heapify.

=> 2 Types of Heap :-
(a) Min heap
   -Root node is the smallest of all the other nodes.
   -The value of every parent node is always (smaller tahn equal to)<= the value of the child nodes.
(b) Max heap
   -Root node is the largest of all the other nodes.
   -The value of every parent node is always >=(greater than equal to) the value of the child nodes.
